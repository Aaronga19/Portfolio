# Portfolio
This is my portfolio. Here I show what I've been working during my learning as Software Devoleper and Data Scientist which are my favorite topics.

## To run this proyect by your own 
To run this project is necessary to have Python 3.7.1 or higher. 

This was developed with Django and Bootstrap mainly, hence, you have to install and run the portfolio with all the libraries pointed out in the _requirements_ folder 

## Currently
_This project isn't still in a host, because it continues in develop to deploy it in Digital Ocean with Docker_
